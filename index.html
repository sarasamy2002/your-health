                        <br>

                        <p>A calorie deficit is when a person consumes less calories than they burn.<br> 
                            A person’s individual health and circumstances will affect their calorie needs.<br> 
                         
                                    A person can create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than they need to maintain their body weight. Over time, this calorie reduction can lead to weight loss.<br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    There is no single calorie deficit value that will ensure weight loss in all people. <br> 
                                    However, in many cases, a consistent 500-calorie daily deficit will roughly equate to 1 pound (lbs) of fat loss per week.<br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    This article covers everything people need to know about calorie deficits and weight loss.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    <h1> How Do You Figure Out Your Calorie Deficit?</h1> <br> 
                                    <p>  To determine how to achieve a calorie deficit, you first need to choose#6b705c;
                                     an approach. If you’d like to reduce your calorie consumption through<br> 
                                      intermittent fasting, choose one of the four methods listed above.<br> 
                                      <br> 
                                    If you plan to achieve a deficit by increasing your calorie output through<br> 
                                     exercise, you'll need to track the amount of calories you burn.<br> 
                                    
                                    Based on your weight and activity type and length, you can estimate<br> 
                                     how many calories you'll burn in a workout. For example, a 154-pound<br> 
                                      person will burn 280 calories walking at 3.5 miles per hour for one hour<br> 
                                      <br> 
                                      <br> 
                                    You can also use a wearable tracker device to measure your activity and <br> 
                                    personal calorie output throughout the day<br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    If you are creating a deficit by reducing the amount of calories you<br> 
                                     consume, it may be helpful to track your meals, snacks, and beverages<br> 
                                      using a nutrition app. Seeing where your calories come from can help<br> 
                                       you decide how and when to cut back <br> 
                                       <br> 
                                    For example, you can lower your daily calorie intake by:<br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    .Replacing a higher calorie food with lower calorie alternative<br> 
                                     Swap ¾ cup cooked white rice with riced cauliflower to save 120 calories<br> 
                                    Reducing your portion sizes. Eat one slice of a 14-inch cheese pizza instead of<br> 
                                     two to save 236 calories<br> 
                                    .Cutting out sugary beverages. Drink 12-ounces of water instead of 12-ounces of ginger ale to save 124 calories<br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    Keep in mind that once you achieve a calorie deficit, it can be difficult <br> 
                                    to predict the amount and rate of weight loss you’ll experience. Each <br> 
                                    person's metabolism and activity level is different, both of which can<br> 
                                     play a role in calorie outputs.</p>
                                     <br>
                                     <br>

                                     <h1> How IT WORKS ?</h1> <br>

                                     <p>The ketogenic diet involves consuming a very low amount of<br>
                                     carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy.
                                     <br>
                                     Health benefits can include weight lossand lowering your risk for certain diseases<br>
                                     <br>
                                     In following a keto meal plan, you’ll be severely limiting carbs. Start off with <br>
                                     between 20 and 30 grams (g) of carbohydrates per day, says the New York City–<br>
                                     based dietitian Kristen Mancinelli, RD, author of The Ketogenic Diet: A<br>

                                      <br>
                                     Also make sure that you know what foods have mostly carbs, fat, and protein,<br>
                                      so you can make the right choices. For instance, it’s not just bread, pasta, chips, <br>
                                      cookies, candy, and ice cream that contain carbs. Beans may contain protein,<br>
                                       but they’re also very high in carbohydrates. Fruit and veggies also mostly<br>
                                        contain carbs. The only foods that don’t contain carbs are meat (protein) and <br>
                                        pure fats like butter and olive oil.<br>
                                   
                                    

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h1>3. LOW CARB DIET</h1>
                                       
                                        <br>

   
                                        <p>Low carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins<br>
                                             diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low carb, high fat (LCHF) diet.<br>
                                             <br>
                                            Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very low carb diets like<br> the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or<br>
                                             less for other types<br>
                                             <br>

                                             <p>Low carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.<br>
                                                <br>
                                             They’re typically higher in protein than low fat diets, which is important, as protein can help <br>
                                                curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserves muscle mass. <br>

                                               In very low carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy<br>
                                                by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis.<br> <br>

                                                <p>Research suggests that low carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including high<br>
                                                     cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve blood sugar and insulin levels in<br>

                                                    Many studies indicate that low carb diets can aid weight loss and may be more effective than <br>
                                                    conventional low fat diets. <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    For example, a review of 53 studies made up of 68,128 participants found that low carb diets<br>
                                                     resulted in significantly more weight loss than low fat diets .<br>
                                                    What’s more, low carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful belly fat .

  <h1>How to Start a New Habit That Actually Sticks </h1>
  <p>Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” 

      When it comes to living a positive lifestyle, our habits can either make or break us. Habits decide our physical health, emotional well-being and even our outlook on life. 
      
      But when it’s time to start a new healthy habit, it can be pretty difficult. If you want to start the new year with a habit that will actually stick, check out these tips to get started.

  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2> 
      1. Use a trigger.
  </h2><br>
  <p> 
      All habits—negative or positive—come from a triggering action. A trigger automatically initiates a behavior and leads you to do something else. Using cues like time of day, place and circumstance with your trigger will increase the likelihood that your habit will stick.

      Use the trigger process to remind yourself when developing a new habit. A good reminder encodes your new behavior in something that you already do. For example, “Before breakfast and after I shower, I will meditate for five minutes every day.” By incorporating your new habit into behaviors you already practice, it will be easier to remember.

  </p>
  <h2>
      2. Start small with your habits.
  </h2><br>
  <p> Lasting change is a product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It’s important to start your habits small so they’re easier to manage and can grow through time. 

      First, decide what you want your new habit to be. Then, ask yourself how you can make this behavior so easy you can do it without thinking. Slowly build on that simple task, stick to a sustainable pace and be patient—big changes take time.
  
  </p>
  <h2>
      3. Keep a larger goal in mind.
  </h2><br>
  <p>
      
   Keep your immediate goals small but remember to dream big for the future. Decide on your ultimate larger goal, and then develop a plan with smaller steps to get there. Make bigger goals a reality by doing a little work each day to achieve them.

    By establishing your larger goal, you’ll have something set in mind while working every day on small steps. For example, if your goal is to write a book, start by journaling 10 minutes every day, then incrementally increase the time and effort you put into writing.   
  </p>
  <h2>
      4. Reward yourself.
  </h2><br>
  <p>
      It’s important to stay positive while creating new habits, and the best way to do this is by rewarding yourself for even the smallest of victories. If you complete an action and have a positive reward at the end of it, you’re more likely to do that same action again and form a routine. Repeat this routine enough, and it becomes a habit.

      Reward yourself each time you practice your habit. This can be something as simple as congratulating yourself or getting yourself a treat. 
  </p> 
  <h2>
      5. Get back on track quickly.
  </h2> <br>
  <p>
      Nobody’s perfect, and you won’t be perfect when you’re developing a habit. It’s okay to make mistakes, but it’s important to get back on track quickly when you do. Abandon the all-or-nothing mentality—instead, plan for failure. Missing a habit once or twice is OK, but be consistent enough to not do it repeatedly and return to the behavior as soon as possible.

Focus on building the identity of someone who never misses a habit twice. Examine where your habit breaks down, then incorporate an if-then scenario. For example, “If I forget to meditate in the morning, then I will meditate for five minutes when I get home from work.”



On average, a new habit takes 30 days to develop, so don’t be discouraged if you struggle at first. Stay positive, focus on the goal and your new habit will get easier. Good luck in the new year!
